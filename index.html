<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hello! I am a senior computer science major at the University of Maryland, with a concentration in machine learning and minors in statistics and business. I hope to harness my fascination with machine learning to explore data science for social good. Beyond coding, I am a member of my university orchestra, co-president of the Association for Women in Computing, an undergraduate teaching assistant for Data Structures, and a Peer Mentor for the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences.
  <br></br>
My portfolio showcases the projects that I have worked on so far, and I am proud to share them with you! These projects highlight my technical abilities as well as my interests in the use of applied machine learning in industries in which it can make a societal impact.</p>

<h3>My Projects</h3>
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://kperk103.github.io/melanoma_detection/"><span class="change-color">The Use of Convolutional Neural Networks in Melanoma Detection</span></a>: With this project, my aim was to explore the potential use of machine learning models in melanoma diagnosis. I designed a PyTorch convolutional neural network that diagnosed melanoma from mole images, resulting in a testing accuracy and F1 score of 90%.</li>
<li><a href="https://kperk103.github.io/fake_news/"><span class="change-color">The Use of Deep Neural Networks to Determine the Authenticity of News</span></a>: In collaboration with a group, I worked to utilize BERT and a self-implemented PyTorch LSTM model to detect fake news articles. Our model achieved a 96% testing accuracy and F1 score.</li>
<li><a href="https://kperk103.github.io/climate_change/"><span class="change-color">Data Science and Global Warming: A Closer Look at Rising Temperatures</span></a>: My goal for this project was to raise awareness surrounding climate change and carbon dioxide emissions. I applied linear regression modeling to analyze the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, average annual temperatures, and year, enabling me to find trends among the data and predict future temperatures.</li>
